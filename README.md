# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
      - is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics
      
      -It is easy to learn
      -Large and Active Community
      -Versatility
      -Platform Independence and Portability
      -Strong Industry Adoption

      -Web Development
         -Frameworks like Django and Flask
      Data Analysis and Visualization
         -Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
      -Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
         -Libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

      -Go to the official Python website: python.org.
      -Navigate to the Downloads section.
      -Choose the latest version of Python that suits your needs
      Select the installer that matches your system architecture

      -Run the Installer
      -Configure Python Installation
         -On the first screen of the installer, ensure that the option "Add Python x.x to PATH" is checked. This will allow you to use Python and pip (Python's package installer) from the command line easily.
      -Install Python
         -Click "Install Now" to begin the installation
      -Verify the Installation
         -Once the installation is complete, you can verify Python installation by opening a command prompt
         -Type python --version or python -V and press Enter. This should display the installed Python version, confirming that Python is installed correctly.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

      -Print("Hello World!")
      -Print Statement
         -The print() function is used to output data to the console in Python. It accepts one or more arguments inside the parentheses
      -Strings
         -"Hello, World" is a string literal enclosed in double quotes.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   -Integer (int)- A Whole numbers without decimals
   -Float (float)- Numbers with decimals
   -String (str)- Ordered collection of characters enclosed in quotes
   -Boolean (bool)- True or False.

   -number1=10
   -number1=3.5555
   -name='samuel'
   -isNotValid=false

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

   -conditionals allows you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a specific condition is true or false
   -Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met

   if name
      you are assigned this roole
   elif
      please check with the manager

   for i in number
      total-= tax

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

      -blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They allow you to break down your program into smaller, modular pieces, making your code more organized, readable, and easier to maintain

      def sum =(a,b)

      return a + b

      answer=sum(1,2)

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

   -Dictionaries
               -Purpose- Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs
               -Key-Value Pair- Each element in a dictionary is stored as a key-value pair, where the key is unique and used to retrieve the corresponding value.
               -Syntax: Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {}, with key-value pairs separated by colons :.
   Lists
               -Purpose: Lists are ordered collections of items.
               -Indexing: Elements in a list are accessed using integer indices, starting from 0.
               -Syntax: Lists are defined using square brackets [], and elements are separated by commas.



      -numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      -person = {
               'name': 'Alice',
               'age': 30,
               'city': 'Wonderland'
                }

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

      - the process of anticipating and handling runtime errors (exceptions) that may occur during the execution of a program

      -try
         answer=x/y
         
      expect divisionerror
         print(Cant Be Divided)
      
      expect typeError as e
         print(f"Error: {e}")
         answer=none
      
      else
         print(f"You Got Your Answer : {answer}")

      finally
         print("Completed")

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

      -mechanisms for organizing and reusing code, facilitating modular programming and enhancing code maintainability

      import math
      print("Square Root Of 72:", math.sqrt(72))

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

      -Open the File: Use the open() function with the file path and mode ('r' for reading).
      -Read from the File: Use methods like read(), readline(), or readlines() to fetch content.
      Close the File: Always close the file using the close() method to free up resources.


      def read_file_and_print(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()  

        print("Content of the file:")
        print(content)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: Permission denied while trying to read '{filename}'.")


        def write_list_to_file(filename, strings_list):
    try:
        
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            for string in strings_list:
                f.write(string + '\n') git push

        print(f"Successfully wrote {len(strings_list)} strings to '{filename}'.")

    except IOError:
        print(f"Error: Could not write to '{filename}'.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: Permission denied while trying to write to '{filename}'.")
